Research Framework. Each color indicates a different section of the methodology whereas the number refer to specific tasks explained in the method section of the workflow with the corresponding number. Steps that have the same number can/will be executed at the same time. The Blue colored boxes refer to the inputs needed to execute the workflow; the Green boxes are referring to the means/transformations that are needed to create outputs indicated in the Red boxes. The Weather Generator, shows a simplification of the process with a more elaborated explanation shown in the orange boxes. To conclude, the Blue arrows show the process of creating the workflow and connecting data, inputs/outputs, and models.
